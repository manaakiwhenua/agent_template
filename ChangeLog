	* ABM_code/ABM4CSL v3_ANH.nlogo: Aadded a fixed random seed for
	development, so that the graphs will be identical when testing
	code changes. modulo function to replace the "occurrence" repeated
	code. This will work after 30 ticks.  I also modified the
	occurrence test so that the update-occurrence function is not
	needed, hopefully what you wanted. Set multiple variables in one
	line, (e.g., set [LU pcolor] [1 8]). This requires netlogo
	6.4.0. converted some repeated code into loops moved some data
	definitions into setup
